## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To set up MenTor on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd MenTor
```

### 2. Database Setup

1.  **Create Database:** Using phpMyAdmin or your preferred MySQL client, create a new database named `mentor_db`.
2.  **Import Schema:** Import the `mentor_db.sql` file located in the project root into your newly created database.

### 3. Web Server Configuration

*   Ensure you have a web server (like Apache or Nginx) with PHP installed.
*   Place the `MenTor` project directory in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache).

### 4. Database Connection

*   Open `includes/db_connect.php`.
*   Update the database connection details (hostname, username, password, database name) if they differ from your local setup.

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_db_username"; // e.g., root
$password = "your_db_password"; // e.g., empty for XAMPP/WAMP default
$dbname = "mentor_db";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

### 5. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where you placed the project (e.g., `http://localhost/MenTor/` or `http://localhost/MenTor/index.html`).

## 🔑 Default Credentials

For initial testing, you can use the following admin credentials:

*   **Email:** `admin@mentor.edu`
*   **Password:** `password` (This password is hashed in the database. You might need to re-hash it or use the `hash_password.php` script to create new admin users.)
